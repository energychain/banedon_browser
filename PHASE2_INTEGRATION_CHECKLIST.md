# Phase 2 Integration Checklist

> ðŸ“– **New to this project?** Start with the **[Phase 2 Handoff Document](PHASE2_HANDOFF.md)** for complete overview and quick start guide.

## ðŸŽ¯ Pre-Integration Verification

### âœ… Service Verification (Complete these before starting integration)

#### 1. Service Health Check
- [ ] Visit [http://10.0.0.2:3010/health](http://10.0.0.2:3010/health)
- [ ] Verify status shows "healthy"
- [ ] Check uptime and session counts

#### 2. Web Dashboard Test
- [ ] Access [http://10.0.0.2:3010](http://10.0.0.2:3010)
- [ ] Verify real-time status updates
- [ ] Test API interface (create session)
- [ ] Download extension package
- [ ] Review OpenAPI specification

#### 3. Extension Installation Test
- [ ] Download extension from dashboard
- [ ] Install in Chrome (developer mode)
- [ ] Create session via API
- [ ] Connect extension to session
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connection works

#### 4. API Testing
- [ ] Test session creation: `POST /api/sessions`
- [ ] Test command execution: `POST /api/sessions/{id}/commands`
- [ ] Test WebSocket connection: `ws://10.0.0.2:3010/ws`
- [ ] Verify CORS settings work with extension

## ðŸ”§ Integration Planning

### Architecture Review Session
- [ ] **Scheduled**: Date/Time: ________________
- [ ] **Attendees**: Phase 1 team + Phase 2 team
- [ ] **Duration**: 2-3 hours
- [ ] **Location**: ________________

#### Session Agenda:
1. **Demo** (30 min): Live demonstration of all features
2. **Code Walkthrough** (45 min): Architecture and key components
3. **API Review** (30 min): OpenAPI spec and integration points
4. **Integration Strategy** (45 min): How to integrate with main app
5. **Q&A** (30 min): Technical questions and clarifications

### Development Environment Setup
- [ ] Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/energychain/banedon_browser`
- [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install`
- [ ] Build extension: `./build.sh`
- [ ] Start service: `npm start`
- [ ] Verify local setup works

### Integration Strategy Decisions
- [ ] **Service Deployment**: 
  - [ ] Option A: Add to main app's docker-compose
  - [ ] Option B: Separate service with service discovery
- [ ] **Authentication**: 
  - [ ] Integrate with existing auth system
  - [ ] Use service-to-service authentication
- [ ] **UI Integration**:
  - [ ] Add browser mode to existing chat interface
  - [ ] Create separate browser automation interface
- [ ] **API Gateway**:
  - [ ] Route through existing API gateway
  - [ ] Direct service communication

## ðŸ“‹ Week 1 Tasks

### Day 1-2: Core Integration
- [ ] Add browser service to main application infrastructure
- [ ] Configure service discovery/networking
- [ ] Set up authentication integration
- [ ] Create API proxy endpoints

### Day 3-4: Basic UI Integration  
- [ ] Add browser mode selection to chat interface
- [ ] Implement session creation from chat
- [ ] Basic command sending from chat interface
- [ ] Status indicators for browser sessions

### Day 5: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Integration testing of all components
- [ ] End-to-end testing: chat â†’ browser automation
- [ ] Error handling verification
- [ ] Performance testing

## ðŸ“‹ Week 2 Tasks

### Day 1-2: Enhanced Features
- [ ] Advanced browser automation features
- [ ] Improved error handling and recovery
- [ ] Better user feedback and status updates
- [ ] Integration with existing logging/monitoring

### Day 3-4: UI/UX Polish
- [ ] Consistent styling with main application
- [ ] User experience improvements
- [ ] Accessibility considerations
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness (if applicable)

### Day 5: Production Preparation
- [ ] Security review and enhancements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Production deployment testing
- [ ] Documentation updates

## ðŸš¨ Known Issues & Considerations

### Performance
- **Session Limit**: Currently tested up to 10 concurrent sessions
- **Memory Usage**: ~20MB per active session
- **Command Latency**: 100-500ms typical response time

### Security
- **CORS**: Currently allows all Chrome extension origins
- **Authentication**: Basic session-based, needs integration
- **Rate Limiting**: Basic implementation, may need enhancement

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Chromium**: Fully supported
- **Firefox**: Extension would need adaptation
- **Safari**: Not currently supported

## ðŸ“ž Support & Contact

### Phase 1 Team Availability
- **Consultation**: Available during Phase 2 integration
- **Response Time**: Within 4 hours for urgent issues
- **Documentation**: All questions/answers will update docs

### Emergency Contacts
- **Service Issues**: Check [http://10.0.0.2:3010/health](http://10.0.0.2:3010/health)
- **Deployment Issues**: Use `./remote-status.sh` for diagnostics
- **Extension Issues**: Check browser console for error messages
